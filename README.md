# Pivot Table in React

This project is a simple pivot table implementation using React, built without any external libraries.

## Features

- Display and manipulate data in a pivot table format.
- Drag and drop functionality to rearrange rows and columns.
- Real-time data aggregation and calculation.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zouhair94/pivot_table.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pivot_table
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running Tests

To launch the test runner in interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with the production build of the app. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
